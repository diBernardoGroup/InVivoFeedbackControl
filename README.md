# InVivoFeedbackControl
This folder contains the raw and processed data for the paper In vivo Feedback Control of an Antithetic Molecular-Titration Motif in Escherichia coli using Microfluidics.

Every folder contains a mat file acquired from an online experiment entitled close_loop_number_of_replica.mat. This file was produced by the segmentation algorithm programmed in Matlab (see Methods section for details of implementation). This algorithm is available upon request. 

The folder Data processed offline contains the files acquired from the offline segmentation algorithm (available upon request). There is a mat file related to every chamber.
